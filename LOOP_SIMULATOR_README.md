## Integration with Dashboard

### Run Simultaneously

1. **Start Dashboard** (Terminal 1):
   ```powershell
   python main.py
   ```

2. **Enable Loop Detection** in dashboard

3. **Run Simulator** (Terminal 2):
   ```powershell
   python simulate_loop.py
   ```

4. **Watch Both**:
   - Simulator: Shows packet generation
   - Dashboard: Shows real-time detection

### Expected Behavior

When running both:
- Simulator generates loop traffic
- Dashboard detects and logs it
- Notifications appear in dashboard
- Database records are created
- Statistics are updated

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: "No interfaces found"
```
Solution:
1. Check network connections: ipconfig /all
2. Ensure at least one interface is connected
3. Try running as Administrator
```

### Issue: "Permission denied"
```
Solution:
Run as Administrator (Windows) or with sudo (Linux)
```

### Issue: No packets detected
```
Possible causes:
1. Wrong interface selected
2. Firewall blocking Scapy
3. Detection not running in dashboard

Solutions:
- Select correct interface manually
- Disable firewall temporarily
- Verify dashboard loop detection is enabled
```

### Issue: Detection not working
```
Check:
1. Dashboard loop detection is running
2. Correct interface selected in both
3. Detection interval settings (default 3-5 min)

Force detection:
- Use manual scan in dashboard
- Run "Broadcast Storm" scenario (high severity)
```

## Performance Notes

### Resource Usage
- **CPU**: Low to moderate (10-30% during simulation)
- **Memory**: ~50-100 MB
- **Network**: Generates specified packets per second
- **Duration**: Each scenario: 10-20 seconds

### Recommended Hardware
- **CPU**: Any modern processor
- **RAM**: 2 GB minimum
- **Network**: Active network interface
- **OS**: Windows 10/11, Linux, macOS

## Best Practices

### 1. Start Simple
```
Run order:
1. Clean ‚Üí Verify baseline
2. Suspicious ‚Üí Test moderate detection
3. Broadcast Storm ‚Üí Confirm loop detection works
```

### 2. Document Results
```
For each scenario, note:
- Detection status (Clean/Suspicious/Loop)
- Severity score
- Number of offenders
- Time to detection
```

### 3. Test Regularly
```
- After code changes
- Before deployment
- When adding new features
- During troubleshooting
```

### 4. Use Comparison Mode
```
Compare similar scenarios:
- Broadcast vs Multicast storms
- ARP vs ICMP floods
- Different packet rates
```

## Advanced Usage

### Custom Packet Rates

Edit `TEST_SCENARIOS` in code:
```python
"custom_storm": {
    "packets_per_sec": 120,  # Adjust rate
    "duration": 30,          # Adjust duration
    "description": "Custom test",
    "loop_type": "broadcast"
}
```

### Add New Loop Types

1. Create packet generator:
```python
def create_my_packet():
    return Ether(dst="...") / IP(...) / ...
```

2. Create simulator:
```python
def simulate_my_loop(duration, packets_per_sec):
    # Implementation
```

3. Add to scenarios:
```python
"my_loop": {
    "packets_per_sec": 50,
    "duration": 15,
    "description": "My custom loop",
    "loop_type": "custom"
}
```

### Modify Detection Thresholds

In `detect_loops_lightweight()`:
```python
threshold=30,  # Adjust this value
```

Lower = more sensitive (detect smaller loops)
Higher = less sensitive (only detect major loops)

## Testing Checklist

Before deploying to production:

- [ ] Clean network shows "Clean"
- [ ] Suspicious activity shows "Suspicious"
- [ ] Broadcast storm shows "Loop Detected"
- [ ] ARP storm shows "Loop Detected"
- [ ] Cross-subnet detection works
- [ ] MAC flapping is detected
- [ ] Burst patterns are detected
- [ ] Multi-protocol storms are detected
- [ ] Dashboard notifications work
- [ ] Database records are created
- [ ] Multi-interface detection works
- [ ] All scenarios complete without errors

## FAQ

**Q: How long should I run each scenario?**
A: Default durations (10-20s) are sufficient. Longer tests don't improve detection.

**Q: Can I run multiple scenarios at once?**
A: Use "Continuous" mode (option 14) to run all sequentially.

**Q: Why aren't loops detected?**
A: Ensure dashboard loop detection is running and check detection interval (default 3-5 min).

**Q: Can I use this on production networks?**
A: **NO!** This generates heavy traffic that can disrupt production. Test on isolated networks only.

**Q: What's the difference between Suspicious and Loop Detected?**
A: Suspicious = elevated activity (40-80 severity). Loop = confirmed loop (80+ severity).

**Q: How do I verify detection accuracy?**
A: Compare simulator output with dashboard detection results. Both should show similar status.

## Support
