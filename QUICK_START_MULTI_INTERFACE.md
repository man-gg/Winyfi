# 🚀 Quick Start: Multi-Interface Loop Detection

## ✅ Setup Complete!

Your network monitoring system now monitors **ALL active network interfaces** to detect loops across your entire network infrastructure.

## 🎯 What This Means For Your Setup

### Your Network Configuration
```
Internet
   │
Router/Switch
   │
   ├─── LAN (APs connected here)
   │      ├─── AP 1
   │      ├─── AP 2
   │      └─── AP 3
   │
   └─── Admin PC (WiFi OR LAN connection)
            └─── Dashboard App
                 └─── Monitors BOTH:
                      ├─── WiFi segment
                      └─── LAN segment (where APs are)
```

### Key Benefits
✅ **Works with ANY connection**: Admin app can use WiFi or LAN  
✅ **Monitors entire network**: Sees loops on all network segments  
✅ **Parallel scanning**: Fast and efficient  
✅ **Cross-interface detection**: Spots loops that span multiple segments  

## 🏃 Running the Application

### 1. Start Dashboard (As Administrator)

**Windows PowerShell (Run as Administrator):**
```powershell
cd "C:\Users\63967\Desktop\network monitoring"
python main.py
```

**Why Administrator?** Packet capture requires elevated privileges.

### 2. Enable Automatic Loop Detection

In the dashboard:
1. Click **"Loop Detection"** button/tab
2. Click **"▶ Start Auto"** button
3. Monitor runs in background every 5 minutes (configurable)

### 3. Manual Scan (Optional)

To scan immediately:
1. Open **Loop Detection Monitor** modal
2. Go to **"🔍 Manual Scan"** tab
3. Click **"▶ Run Manual Scan"**
4. View results in real-time

## 📊 Understanding the Results

### Interface Information

You'll see which interfaces were scanned:
```
🌐 Network Coverage:
   Interfaces Scanned: 2/2
   Interface Names: Wi-Fi, Ethernet
   Cross-Interface Activity: ✓ No
```

### Status Indicators

| Status | Icon | Meaning |
|--------|------|---------|
| **Clean** | ✅ | No loops detected on any interface |
| **Suspicious** | ⚠️ | Unusual traffic patterns detected |
| **Loop Detected** | 🔴 | Confirmed network loop found |

### Cross-Interface Activity

**Most Important Indicator!**
```
Cross-Interface Activity: ⚠️ YES!
```

If you see **YES**, it means:
- Same MAC address sending high traffic on multiple interfaces
- Strong indication of a network loop
- Requires immediate attention

## 🔧 Configuration

### Adjust Detection Interval

1. Open **Loop Detection Monitor**
2. Go to **"⚙️ Configuration"** tab
3. Set **"Auto Detection Interval"** (minutes)
4. Click **"Update Interval"**

**Recommended:**
- Small network (1-10 APs): 10-15 minutes
- Medium network (10-50 APs): 5 minutes
- Large network (50+ APs): 3 minutes

### Adjust Sensitivity

Edit `dashboard.py` line ~10748:

```python
detect_loops_multi_interface(
    timeout=3,      # Increase for more thorough scans (3-10 seconds)
    threshold=30,   # Lower for more sensitivity (20-40)
    use_sampling=True
)
```

## 📱 Notifications

When a loop is detected:
1. **Notification badge** appears in dashboard
2. **Status changes** to "Loop Detected" or "Suspicious"
3. **Database record** saved with full details
4. **Modal shows** per-interface breakdown

Click the notification icon to view details.

## 📈 Viewing History

### In Loop Detection Monitor

1. Go to **"📊 Statistics & History"** tab
2. View:
   - Total detections
   - Loops found
   - Suspicious activity
   - Detection history table

### Statistics Cards
```
┌──────────────┐ ┌──────────────┐ ┌──────────────┐ ┌──────────────┐
│ 📈 Total     │ │ ⚠️ Loops     │ │ 🔍 Suspicious│ │ ✅ Clean     │
│    Detections│ │    Detected  │ │    Activity  │ │    Detections│
│      328     │ │       0      │ │       0      │ │      328     │
└──────────────┘ └──────────────┘ └──────────────┘ └──────────────┘
```

### Export History

Click **"📊 Export"** to save detection history to file.

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### Issue: "No active network interfaces found"

**Solution:**
```powershell
# Check network connections
ipconfig /all

# Ensure at least one interface has an IP
ping 8.8.8.8
```

### Issue: "Permission denied" / "Access is denied"

**Solution:** Run PowerShell as Administrator
```powershell
# Right-click PowerShell → Run as Administrator
python main.py
```

### Issue: Only WiFi scanned, not Ethernet

**Check:** Ethernet cable might be disconnected

Expected output when both connected:
```
🌐 Active network interfaces detected: Wi-Fi, Ethernet
```

### Issue: High CPU usage during scans

**Solution:** Scans are brief (5-8 seconds) and use sampling. If concerned:
```python
# Reduce timeout
timeout=2  # Instead of 5
```

## 🎓 Advanced Features

### Per-Interface Results

After each scan, you'll see breakdown per interface:

```
📡 Per-Interface Results:
  ✓ Wi-Fi: 243 packets, 0 offenders
  ✓ Ethernet: 244 packets, 0 offenders
```

### Efficiency Metrics

```
⚡ Multi-Interface Scan Metrics:
  • Detection Method: MULTI_INTERFACE
  • Interfaces Scanned: 2/2
  • Scan Duration: 5.08s
  • Packets/Second: 95.6
  • Cross-Interface Activity: No
  • Unique MACs Detected: 12
```

## 📋 Testing

Run the test suite to verify everything works:

```powershell
# As Administrator
python test_multi_interface_detection.py
```

Expected output:
```
============================================================
TEST SUMMARY
============================================================
Interface Detection            ✅ PASSED
Multi-Interface Detection      ✅ PASSED
Database Integration           ✅ PASSED

```

## 🎯 Best Practices

### 1. Keep Auto-Detection Running
```python
# Enable on dashboard startup
self.start_loop_detection()
```

### 2. Monitor Notifications
- Check notification badge regularly
- Investigate suspicious activity promptly
- Review detection history weekly

### 3. Regular Manual Scans
- Run manual scan when network issues occur
- Use during maintenance windows
- Before and after topology changes

### 4. Database Maintenance
```sql
-- Monthly cleanup (optional)
DELETE FROM loop_detections 
WHERE detection_time < DATE_SUB(NOW(), INTERVAL 30 DAY)
AND status = 'clean';
```

## 📞 Common Scenarios

### Scenario 1: New AP Added
**Action:** Run manual scan to verify no loops introduced

### Scenario 2: Network Slowdown
**Action:** Check Loop Detection Monitor for suspicious activity

### Scenario 3: Switch Replacement
**Action:** Stop auto-detection, replace switch, run manual scan, resume auto-detection

### Scenario 4: WiFi Issues
**Action:** Check if WiFi interface shows high packet counts or offenders
