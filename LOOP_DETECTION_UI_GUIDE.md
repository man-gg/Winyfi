## Testing Loop Detection Visibility

### Quick Test:

```powershell
# Terminal 1 - Start Dashboard
python main.py
# Enable loop detection (Start Auto button in Loop Test modal)

# Terminal 2 - Run Simulator
python auto_loop_simulator.py
```

### What Should Happen (in order):

1. **Status indicator changes**:
   - ‚ö™ Idle ‚Üí üîÑ Scanning... ‚Üí üî¥ Loop Detected!

2. **Popup appears** (after ~30 seconds):
   - Alert window pops up
   - Shows severity score and details
   - You must click OK to dismiss

3. **Console shows detection**:
   - "‚ö†Ô∏è LOOP DETECTED!" message
   - Severity and offender details

4. **Notification badge** (if enabled):
   - Red badge appears on bell icon
   - Shows number of alerts

5. **Modal updates** (if open):
   - History table shows new detection
   - Statistics counters increment
   - Status changes to "Loop Detected"

## Troubleshooting UI Issues

### Issue: Status Indicator Not Updating

**Symptoms**: Shows "‚ö™ Idle" even after detection

**Cause**: Loop detection not enabled

**Solution**:
1. Click "üîÑ Loop Test" button
2. Click "‚ñ∂ Start Auto" button
3. Wait for status to change to "üîÑ Scanning..."

---

### Issue: No Popup Alert

**Symptoms**: Detection happening but no alert window

**Possible Causes**:
1. Severity below threshold (need >22.5 for "loop_detected")
2. Status is "suspicious" not "loop_detected" (no popup for suspicious)
3. Already dismissed the popup

**Check**:
- Look at status indicator (shows severity score)
- Check console output for severity value
- If severity < 22.5, it's suspicious (no popup), not loop

---

### Issue: Modal Shows Old Data

**Symptoms**: Loop Test modal doesn't show latest detection

**Solution**:
1. Close the modal
2. Re-open with "üîÑ Loop Test" button
3. OR click "üîÑ Refresh" in the History tab

---

### Issue: Nothing Visible at All

**Symptoms**: No status changes, no detections

**Causes**:
1. Loop detection not started
2. No loops on network
3. Simulator not running

**Solutions**:
1. Enable auto-detection: Loop Test ‚Üí Start Auto
2. Run simulator: `python auto_loop_simulator.py`
3. Wait 5 minutes for detection cycle
4. OR use Manual Scan for immediate results

---

## What "Suspicious" Means vs "Loop Detected"

### Suspicious (üü°):
- Severity: 7.5 - 22.5
- Light unusual traffic
- Could be normal network activity
- **No popup alert** (less intrusive)
- Console shows "üü° SUSPICIOUS ACTIVITY"

### Loop Detected (üî¥):
- Severity: > 22.5
- Clear loop indication
- **Popup alert appears**
- Console shows "‚ö†Ô∏è LOOP DETECTED!"
- Requires investigation

---

## Expected Behavior with Simulator

When you run `python auto_loop_simulator.py`:

**Timeline**:
- 0:00 - Simulator starts
- 0:60 - Simulator completes (sent ~2500 packets)
- 0:60-5:00 - Wait for detection cycle
- ~5:00 - Detection occurs
- ~5:01 - **Status indicator updates to üî¥**
- ~5:02 - **Popup alert appears**
- ~5:03 - **Console shows detection**
- ~5:04 - **Notification badge appears**

**OR for immediate detection**:
1. Run simulator
2. Open Loop Test modal
3. Go to Manual Scan tab
4. Click "‚ñ∂ Run Manual Scan"
5. Results in 5 seconds!
